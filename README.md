## 📌 Project Overview  

This thesis explores the relationship between **Emotional Intelligence (EI)** and **Sleep Quality** among university students using advanced **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques.

University students frequently experience academic pressure, emotional stress, and lifestyle changes that affect both their emotional well-being and sleep patterns. This study aims to uncover complex, non-linear relationships between emotional intelligence traits and various sleep quality indicators.

Unlike traditional statistical methods, this research integrates **Machine Learning models** with **Explainable AI (XAI)** techniques to generate interpretable and data-driven insights.

## 🎯 Research Objectives  

- Analyze the impact of Emotional Intelligence on Sleep Quality  
- Identify key EI traits influencing sleep duration, consistency, and disturbance  
- Develop predictive Machine Learning models  
- Apply Explainable AI for model transparency  
- Provide actionable insights for improving student well-being

## 📚 Background  

Poor sleep quality is linked to:

- Cognitive impairment  
- Reduced academic performance  
- Increased anxiety and stress  

Emotional Intelligence plays a vital role in:

- Emotional regulation  
- Stress management  
- Interpersonal relationship improvement  

Understanding their interaction may support better mental health strategies and academic success among students.
